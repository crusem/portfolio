The objective of this project was to build a machine learning algorithm based off of environmental risk factors to predict risk of overdose occurence in Cincinnati, Ohio. In addition to predicting risk of overdose, this model can serve as a sighting mechanism for harm reduction resources in Cincinnati, Ohio.

The objective of this project was to build a machine learning algorithm based off of asthma risk factors to predict asthma prevalence in Philadelphia, PA. Our analysis builds a random forest regression model in order to predict asthma prevalence by census tract in the City of Philadelphia, validating our model against the estimated asthma prevalence from the CDC.
