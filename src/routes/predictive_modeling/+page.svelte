<h2>Predict Heroin Overdose Occurrence to Allocate Prevention Resources in Cincinnati, Ohio</h2>

<p>
This project was submitted by Marissa Cruse and Alyssa Felix-Arreola during the 2023 Fall semester for Public Policy Analytics at the Weitzman School of Design at the University of Pennsylvania.

The objective of this project was to build a machine learning algorithm based off of environmental risk factors to predict risk of overdose occurence in Cincinnati, Ohio. In addition to predicting risk of overdose, this model can serve as a sighting mechanism for harm reduction resources in Cincinnati, Ohio.

<h2>Predict Asthma Prevalance by Census Tract in Philadelpia, PA</h2>

<p>
This project was submitted by Marissa Cruse and Alyssa Felix-Arreola during the 2023 Fall semester for Geospatial Data Science in Python at the Weitzman School of Design at the University of Pennsylvania.

The objective of this project was to build a machine learning algorithm based off of asthma risk factors to predict asthma prevalence in Philadelphia, PA. Our analysis builds a random forest regression model in order to predict asthma prevalence by census tract in the City of Philadelphia, validating our model against the estimated asthma prevalence from the CDC.
